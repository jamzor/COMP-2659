				Model Functionality
				
	-	This is a simple file to make a running list of the model's functionality.
	-	This list can be added to and removed from based on changes to the design.
	- 	This will keep an ongoing list of what is done, and what needs to be done.
	
Functional Components:												
	
	Component:													Status:
	
		Cell:
		-	a Single cell in the Grid							->
		-	works as a boolean value:							->
			-	0 means the Cell is empty						
			-	1 means the Cell is full
			
		Grid:
		-	2D array of cells. 									->
		- 	Is the source or boundary and proximity checking 	->
			for shape movement.		
		-	Is queried in order to determine if points should	-> 
			be awarded and cells should be removed.
		
		Shape:
		-	current shape being controlled/moved				->
		-	represented as a simple 4x4 2d array of 0s and 1s	->
		-	holds a top right x and y value to tell where the 	->
			2d array of bits has been drawn on the grid. 
			(values can be negative and can exceed the grid 
			constraints).
	
		Time:	
		-	a double value (may change to a time specific		->
			type) to hold the elapsed game time	
		-	gets synchronously updated every second				->
		
		Score:
		-	keeps track of the player's score					->
		-	updates after checking the grid for complete rows.	->
		-	an addition / multiplier method to compound the 	->
			points and add to the running total
