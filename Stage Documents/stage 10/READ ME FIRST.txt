Stage 10 actually consists of three independent tasks - 10a, 10b and 10c -
any combination of which can be attempted in any order.  It is suggested
that 10a may be the easiest one to start with.  Stage 10c is likely the
most time-consuming.

Stage 10a: completing the mouse-driven spash screen

Stage 10b: burning custom game ROMs

Stage 10c: 2-player mode
